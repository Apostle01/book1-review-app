### Database Design

book1-review-app is based on a relational database. The database is made up of 3 tables, a User, Book and Review table. The tables are related via their primary and foreign keys in addition to the backrefs which made querying the database easier.

The backref command `reviews = db.relationship(
        'Review', backref='user')` on the User table creates a virtual column on the Review table called user making it easier to query the database. For example, you can access the reviews from the user table using `User.reviews` at the same time you can access a user from the reviews table using `Review.user`. This approach has been beneficial when displaying reviews linked to different users.

The relationship between the tables are as follows:

- User to Review: One-to-Many. One user can write many reviews. This relationship is defined using `db.relationship` in the User model and the `db.ForeignKey` in the Review model.
- Book to Review: One-to-Many. One book can have many reviews. This relationship is defined using `db.relationship` in the Book model and the `db.ForeignKey` in the Review model.

. `/edit/<int:id>`:Edit a book review (admin only)
. `/delete/<int:id>`:Delete a book review (admin only)

Administrator Privilages

To give a user administrator privilages,  you need to manually update the database. You can do this by running a Python shell within your Flask app context on Heroku:
    heroku run flask shell

Then execute the following commands:
    from models import User
    User = User.query.filter_by(username='your_admin_username').first()
    user.is_admin = True
    db.session.commit()

Replace your_admin_username with the username of the user you want to promote to administrator.

Error Handling

A custom 404 page is provided for handling non-existent routes. You can customize this page by editing the '404.html' file in thee template directoru.

### How to Fork

To fork the repository:

1. Log in (or sign up) to Github.

2. Go to the repository for this project, [].

3. Click the Fork button in the top right corner.

### Remote Deployment Heroku

1. Create a database using [CI Database Maker](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/). Once created, a URL to the database will be provided. Save this URL for later on in the process.

2. In order for Heroku to run the project, two files need to be created in the IDE workspace.

    - A requirements.txt file contains a list of the Python dependencies that our project needs to run successfully.
    - A Procfile contains the start command to run the project.

- To create the requirements.txt file, run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
- To create the Procfile run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```

    NOTE: The Procfile uses a capital P and doesn't have a file extension on the end. Ensure there is no blank line at the end of the file as this can cause problems for deployment.

    Save all files then add, commit and push the changes to GitHub.

3. Login (or sign up) to [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com).

4. Click the new button and then click Create New App.

5. Choose a unique name for your app, select the region closest to you and click “Create app.

6. Go to the Settings tab of your new app.

7. Click Reveal Config Vars.

8. Add a Config Var called DATABASE_URL and paste your CI database URL in as the value. Make sure you click “Add”.

9. Add each of your other environment variables except DEVELOPMENT and DB_URL from the env.py file as a Config Var. The result should look something like this:

   ![config variables](docs/config-vars.png)

 - NOTE: Delete the DEBUG variable once debugging is complete. 

10. Navigate to the “Deploy” tab of your app.

11. In the Deployment method section, select “Connect to GitHub”.

12. Search for Apostle01/book1-review-app repo and click Connect.

13. Optional: You can click Enable Automatic Deploys in case you make any further changes to the project. This will trigger any time code is pushed to your GitHub repository.

14. Click Deploy Branch - This will start the build process.

15. Similarly to local deployment, the tables from models.py need to be added to the database.

    - To do this, we can click the “More” button and select “Run console”.
    - Type python app.py into the console and click Run.
    - This opens the Python terminal. Now create the tables with the commands:

        ```bash
           from padomabook-review-app import db
        ```
        ```bash
           db.create_all()
        ```
        ```bash
           exit()
        ```
